# Salesforce Case Highlighter Chrome Extension

A productivity Chrome Extension that highlights Salesforce Case list rows based on matching critical keywords, SLA age, and known urgency patterns.

## 🚀 Prompt-Based Architecture Summary

> **Prompt Used for Design & Engineering:**

> _Act as a senior software engineer and Chrome extension architect. Build a Chrome Extension named_ **“Salesforce Case Highlighter”** _that enhances productivity for Salesforce support teams by highlighting P1 or critical cases in the Salesforce Case List View._

### 🔍 Functional Requirements:
- Detect cases containing:
  - User-defined keywords ("urgent", "asap", "P1", etc.)
  - Predefined regex patterns ("customer impact", "site outage")
- Highlight case rows in color-coded priority levels
- Add case age timer next to each row
- Auto-refresh after page load (content script based)

### 🎨 Visual Rules:
| Color   | Condition                       |
|---------|----------------------------------|
| 🔴 Red   | P1 keywords or > 60 min age     |
| 🟠 Yellow| Age > 30 min, < 60 min          |
| 🟢 Green | Age < 30 min                    |

## 🧠 Features
- Regex-based row highlighting
- Real-time SLA timer with color-coded visual cues
- Configurable via popup (keywords, sound toggle, SLA thresholds)
- Client-side only, no Salesforce API required
- Safe to use in Lightning Experience

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration
- Add/edit keywords from popup
- Set SLA thresholds
- Toggle sound alerts (planned)
- Priority filters (P1, P2, etc.)

## 🧪 Installation
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click `Load Unpacked` and select this folder
5. Visit your Salesforce Case List page

## 🧠 Built for Real-World Scenarios
This tool was designed after analyzing workflows of support engineers struggling to detect:
- "Production Down" tickets
- "Security breach" escalations
- "Customer Login Failure" and SLA-aged tickets

## 📈 Business Value
- ⏳ Saves 3–5 minutes per ticket triage
- 📊 Reduces SLA violations from delayed detection
- 🧘‍♀️ Improves agent focus and workload triaging

# Salesforce Case Highlighter - Chrome Extension

## 📌 Project Overview
Salesforce Case Highlighter is a lightweight Chrome extension that enhances Salesforce support workflows by **highlighting P1/critical cases** directly in the Salesforce Case List View. It improves case triaging, ensures SLA compliance, and reduces manual scanning of support queues.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Support agents often face challenges identifying urgent cases as:
- All tickets look identical in the list view.
- Priority is not visually indicated.
- SLAs are breached due to delayed identification.

Salesforce doesn’t provide built-in color coding or alerting. This extension bridges that gap.

---

## 💡 Solution Summary
The extension hooks into the Salesforce Case List DOM and highlights rows based on:
- Keywords (e.g., "urgent", "ASAP", "production down")
- Case age (time since creation)
- Regex patterns matching known escalation indicators (e.g., "security breach")

It runs entirely in the browser and does not use any Salesforce API or backend service.

## ⚙️ Architecture & Workflow
1. **Content Script (`content.js`)**:
   - Executes after page load
   - Reads each row in the case table
   - Matches text content with keywords or regex patterns
   - Extracts created date and calculates age
   - Applies CSS styles for coloring
   - Appends timer badges to rows

2. **Popup UI (`popup.html`, `popup.js`)**:
   - Lets user add/remove keywords
   - Data stored using `chrome.storage.local`
   - Future tabs for settings and filters

3. **Manifest (`manifest.json`)**:
   - Manifest V3
   - Permission scoped to Salesforce domain
   - Uses `content_scripts` and `action` popup

---

## 🧠 Keyword & Regex Engine
Supports:
- Static keywords (e.g., `P1`, `ASAP`, `Urgent`)
- Regex like `/production\sdown/`
- User-defined keyword additions

---

## ⏱ SLA Timer Logic
- Parses date from row (e.g., 2024-06-25 10:30 AM)
- Compares to `new Date()`
- Thresholds:
  - <30 mins: ✅ Green
  - 30-60 mins: ⚠️ Yellow
  - >60 mins: ❗ Red

---

## 🧪 Installation Instructions
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
3. Enable **Developer Mode**
4. Click `Load Unpacked`
5. Select the project folder
6. Navigate to Salesforce Case View to see it in action
